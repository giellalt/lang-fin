# Guesser
A rule-based morphological guesser is based on using the paradigms from the
dictionary based analyser but replacing the roots with patterns. For Finnish
we have quite neat paradigms with well-defined stem patterns: vowel harmony,
stem vowels and some with specific syllable counts

## Symbols used for guesser `Multichar_Symbols`
Guesser uses a subset of the morphological analyser's alphabet. For
documentation c.f. [morphology root](root-fst-src.html).
