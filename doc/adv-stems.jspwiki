 !!!Adverb classification
 Adverbs are a heterogenous mass of words with defective inflectional,
 usually sourced from various forms of nominals. It would be possible to
 classify adverbs along etymology and semantics, but we do not yet use such
 classification. Only the morphology is recorded in the continuation classes
 and analyses.

 The classification of the adverbs in morphology goes along the possessives
 and clitics they take or require:

__Adverbs examples:__
* __aakkosellisesti: __ {{aakkosellisesti+Adv }}
* __aakkosellisestikin: __ {{aakkosellisesti+Adv+Foc/kin }}
* __mukaani: __ {{mukaan+Adv+PxSg1 }}
* __mukaamme: __ {{mukaan+Adv+PxPl1 }}
* __ajassa: __ {{ajassa+Adv }}
* __ajassako: __ {{ajassa+Adv+Qst }}
