 !!!Adpositions
 Adpositions are morphologically nominals that have defective inflection
 patterns. Some of them come from forms of nominals that are no longer
 used. The adpositions are classified along whether they take possessives
 clitics, or not. They also have slight syntactic and semantic differences,
 the syntactic differences are coded in the analyses to be compatible with
 other languages, but for most intents and purposes all adpositions can
 appear in both syntactic positions, after and before the head word.

 Examples:
