 !!!Interjections
 Interjections are mainly parts of spoken language that are minimal turns
 in dialogue, curses, onomatopoeia and such. Interjections are a subset
 of particles, and do not inflect. They are quite productive kind of, though
 limited in form  ; they stem from arbitrary combinations of characters to
 

 Only add new interjections that are found from corpora.

__Interjections examples:__
* __aah: __ {{aah+Interj }}
* __äh: __ {{äh+Interj }}
