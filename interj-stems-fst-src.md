# Interjections
Interjections are mainly parts of spoken language that are minimal turns
in dialogue, curses, onomatopoeia and such. Interjections are a subset
of particles, and do not inflect. They are quite productive kind of, though
limited in form  ; they stem from arbitrary combinations of characters to


Only add new interjections that are found from corpora.

*Interjections examples:*
* *aah:* `aah+Interj`
* *äh:* `äh+Interj`
