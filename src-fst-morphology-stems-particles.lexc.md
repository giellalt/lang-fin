# Particles
The particles are all words that do not inflect at all. For compatibility
reasons subsets of particles have been set off to classes like conjunctions,
adverbs, adpositions, and interjections. The ones that are *not* in those classes are left here as
particles.

Examples:

* Particles examples:*
* *ahaa:* `ahaa+Pcle`
* *edes:* `edes+Pcle`
